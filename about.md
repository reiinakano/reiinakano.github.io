I'm a software engineer looking to break into ML research.

My main goal is to get computers to understand and imagine in the same way humans understand and imagine.

I am on Twitter (probably way too much) [@reiinakano](https://twitter.com/reiinakano). Feel free to contact me if you want to collaborate on anything!
