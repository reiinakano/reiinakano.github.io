I’m a software engineer working at [a startup](https://infostellar.net) in Tokyo. Although my day job doesn’t involve machine learning, I enjoy the field and try to learn as much as I can about it during my limited free time. 

My main goal is to get computers to understand and imagine in the same way humans understand and imagine.

Currently looking to break into ML research.

I am on Twitter (probably way too much) [@ReiiYoda](https://twitter.com/ReiiYoda). Feel free to contact me if you want to collaborate on anything!
