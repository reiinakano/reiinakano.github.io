I’m a software engineer working at [a startup](https://infostellar.net) in Tokyo. Although my day job doesn’t involve machine learning, I enjoy the field and try to learn as much as I can about it during my limited free time. My main interests are machine learning for creativity and machine learning in the browser. Feel free to contact me if you want to collaborate on anything!

I am on Twitter (probably way too much) [@ReiiYoda](https://twitter.com/ReiiYoda).
