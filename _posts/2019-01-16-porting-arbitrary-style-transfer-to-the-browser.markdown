Recently, [Magenta](magenta), Google's "*open source research project exploring the role of machine learning as a tool in the creative process*" gave me the opportunity to write a blog post on their platform about [my recent work](gh-demo) porting arbitrary style transfer to the browser. Check it out [here](blog-post)!
