In this post, I talk about using [World Models] to train agents to paint with [real painting software][MyPaint] - including my thought process, approach, failures, and future work in this direction I'm excited about.

# Introduction

[Style transfer][1] has always been my favorite deep learning algorithm, and after completing my [previous project][style-transfer-browser] on porting arbitrary style transfer to the browser, I started thinking more deeply about what constitutes *style* in art. (Please note that I have 0 experience in art theory or history and cannot tell you the difference between a Monet or Manet. I just find it fascinating to see neural networks generate pretty things.)

The style loss function introduced by [Gatys, et. al.][1], determines style similarity by comparing the correlations between intermediate convolutional layer activations of a trained VGG image classifier. Simply put, style is defined by how often (or how seldom) a particular image feature occurs with another image feature.

\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

This has always struck me as texture transfer rather than true style transfer, and sure enough, doesn't hold up to certain human-defined "styles".
